# Duris Mud TinTin++ scripts

These scripts are design to work the with Duris mud (Multi User Dungeon) using the TinTin++ mud client.  The design goal is to keep the scripts simple, but effective in reducing user workload, while minimizing screen spam.  To schieve this the scripts are capturing text and sending it to log files, which can then be displayed using the `tail -f` command.

Currently, the scripts themselves are very minimalist, and are just managing information, with some very simple aliases for spellcasting and quality of life automation.  

Plans are to add (in no particular order):
* Auto rescue (for warriors and applicable pet classes)
* Manage replies
* Flesh out class scripts
* Continue Spam reduction
* Basic mapping

I use iTerm on the mac, and have setup a multipane display that opens, and runs all appropriate commands.  See [this guide] https://blog.andrewray.me/how-to-create-custom-iterm2-window-arrangments/ for setting up iTerm to your tastes.
